 * the one scene and renderer every path draws with: the viewport panes, the
 * shot preview card, capture_frame, contact sheets and video export
 * (stage-capture.jsx). Nothing here is a post-process; it is all the same pass.
 *
 * The open stage runs 500 m; without a falloff the whole deck reads at once and
 * the horizon sits a kilometre away. The fog fades the floor INTO the sky colour,
 * so past its far distance the deck simply ceases to exist with no horizon line,
 * no clip edge and no tone break. Haze (stage.lighting.fog) pulls that fade in.
 *
 * Perspective cameras see the gradient sky when skyTop is set; orthographic ones
 * (the plan) keep the flat horizon colour, since a box-mapped sky has no meaning
 * looking straight down. A caller that swaps the background for a pass of its
 * own (render-passes.js) is left alone.
 *
 * The environment light (scene.environment) and the ambient occlusion pass
 * (stage-occlusion.js) are set here too, for the same paths. Both are off in the
 * studio look, which therefore draws exactly what it drew before them. The map
 * is rebuilt only when its colours or the key's direction change.
 *
 * An HDR environment (stage.lighting.hdr, stage-hdr-map.js) replaces that map
 * once it has loaded: its prefiltered texture is the light (prefiltered again
 * only when the map changes; rotation and intensity are uniforms), and with
 * hdrBackground the map itself is the perspective backdrop, the deck fading
 * into the map's horizon colour. Until a file loads, the look's own sky lights.
